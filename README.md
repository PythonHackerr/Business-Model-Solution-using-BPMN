# Business solution for Vegetable Supply Chain using BPMN Model

As part of this project, it was necessary to create a BMPN model showing the business processes taking place
in a chain of stores selling vegetables and warehouses that specialize in storage
vegetables.
Let's start by defining the basic elements of the model. In our model we can distinguish:
three types of enterprises that make up the entire system: vegetable producers, warehouses and
grocery stores. The first pool in our model is the "Store Customers" they represent
customers who need vegetables and who want to buy them in the store we model. Next
we have a "Stores" pool which represents the collection of grocery stores that sell to customers
retail vegetables. The stores' task is also to keep an eye on their stocks by assembling them
orders for vegetables to the headquarters of the warehouse network and collecting the delivered vegetables for the purpose
meet the needs of its customers. The "Shops" pool is divided into 2 lanes: "Service
customers" representing direct interaction with the customer and "Store warehouse", i.e. a place where
where vegetables are stored when they are not available for direct sale. Next one
pool is the "Warehouse Network" which is divided into 2 tracks: "Network Headquarters
warehouses" and "Individual warehouses". The headquarters of the warehouse network acts as an intermediary between
stores and warehouses, which receives orders placed by stores and arranges delivery
appropriate vegetables from warehouses to stores. “Individual warehouses” represents a collection
cold warehouses where vegetables are stored before they are delivered to stores
foodstuffs. The last pool is "Vegetable Producers", i.e. a collection of vegetable producers who
prepare and deliver their vegetables to warehouses.
